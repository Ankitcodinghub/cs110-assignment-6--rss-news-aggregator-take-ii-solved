You‚Äôve spent the last week building a snazzy, multithreaded RSS News Feed Aggregator‚Äîusing as many threads as you wanted to‚Äîto concurrently download news articles from around the globe and build a news.google.com-like search index. This time, you‚Äôre going to revisit the aggregate executable, but instead of employing an unbounded number of threads, you‚Äôre going to rely on a limited number of them‚Äîon the order of 24‚Äîto do everything. This new approach relies on the notion of a thread pool, which is what you‚Äôll spend the vast majority of your time implementing over the course of the next seven days.

The Problem With Assignment 5

Assignment 5‚Äôs NewsAggregator class uses semaphores and mutexes to limit the number of threads that can exist at any one time, but it doesn‚Äôt limit the total number of threads created over the lifetime of an aggregate run. Even if we guarantee that no more than, say, 32 threads ever exist at any one point in time, there‚Äôs no sense creating a thread to do some work only to let it die if we‚Äôre going to need another thread to do pretty much the same thing later on. Building up and tearing down a thread is a relatively expensive process, so we should prefer having a smaller number of threads that live very long lives to a larger number of threads that live very short ones.

An industrial-strength aggregator needs to mitigate competing requirements (employing a bounded number of threads while getting everything off of the main thread as quickly as possible), and nothing we did in Assignment 5 does that.

Here‚Äôs a neat idea: implement a ThreadPool class, which exports the following public interface:

class ThreadPool { public:

ThreadPool(size_t numThreads);

void wait();

~ThreadPool();

};

Here is a simple program that uses a ThreadPool to execute a collection of 10 functions calls using 4 threads.

pool.wait();

cout &lt;&lt; ‚ÄúAll done!‚Äù &lt;&lt; endl;

return 0;

}static const size_t kNumThreads = 4; static const size_t kNumFunctions = 10; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

ThreadPool pool(kNumThreads);

for (size_t id = 0; id &lt; kNumFunctions; id++) {

cout &lt;&lt; oslock &lt;&lt; ‚ÄúThread (ID: ‚Äù &lt;&lt; id &lt;&lt; ‚Äú) has started.‚Äù &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; osunlock;

size_t sleepTime = (id % 3) * 10;

sleep_for(sleepTime);

cout &lt;&lt; oslock &lt;&lt; ‚ÄúThread (ID: ‚Äù &lt;&lt; id &lt;&lt; ‚Äú) has finished.‚Äù &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; osunlock;

});

}

pool.wait();

cout &lt;&lt; ‚ÄúAll done!‚Äù &lt;&lt; endl;

return 0;

}

The output of the above program might look like this:

myth4&gt; ./tptest Thread (ID: 3) has started.

Thread (ID: 2) has started.

Thread (ID: 1) has started.

Thread (ID: 0) has started.

Thread (ID: 3) has finished.

Thread (ID: 4) has started.

Thread (ID: 0) has finished.

Thread (ID: 5) has started.

Thread (ID: 1) has finished.

Thread (ID: 6) has started.

Thread (ID: 4) has finished.

Thread (ID: 7) has started.

Thread (ID: 6) has finished.

Thread (ID: 8) has started.

Thread (ID: 2) has finished.

Thread (ID: 9) has started.

Thread (ID: 9) has finished.

Thread (ID: 5) has finished.

Thread (ID: 7) has finished.

Thread (ID: 8) has finished.

All done! myth4&gt;

In a nutshell, the program‚Äôs ThreadPool creates a small number of worker threads (in this example, four of them) and relies on those four workers to collectively execute all of the scheduled functions (in this example, 10 of them). Yes, yes, we could have spawned ten separate threads and not used a thread pool at all, but that‚Äôs the unscalable approach your solution to Assignment 5 went with, and we‚Äôre trying to improve on that by using a fixed number of threads to maximize parallelism without overwhelming the thread manager.

Milestone 1: Implementing the ThreadPool class

How does one implement this thread pool thing? Well, your ThreadPool constructor‚Äîat least initially‚Äîshould do the following:

‚óè launch a single dispatcher thread like this (assuming dt is a privatethread data member):

dt = thread([this]() {

dispatcher();

});

‚óè launch a specific number of worker threads like this (assuming wts is a private vector&lt;thread&gt; data member):

for (size_t workerID = 0; workerID &lt; numThreads; workerID++) {

wts[workerID] = thread([this](size_t workerID) {

worker(workerID);

}, workerID);

}

The implementation of the private dispatcher method should loop almost interminably, blocking within each iteration until it has confirmation the queue of outstanding functions is nonempty. It should then wait for a worker thread to become available, select it, mark it as unavailable, dequeue the least recently scheduled function, put a copy of that function in a place where the selected worker (and only that worker) can find it, and then signal the worker thread to execute it.

The implementation of wait should block until all previously-scheduled-but-yet-to-be-executed functions have been executed. The ThreadPool destructor should wait until all scheduled functions have executed to completion, somehow inform the dispatcher and worker threads to exit (and wait for them to exit), and then otherwise dispose of all ThreadPool resources.

Your ThreadPool implementation shouldn‚Äôt orphan any memory whatsoever. We‚Äôll be analyzing your ThreadPool using valgrind to ensure no memory is leaked.

Milestone 2: Reimplementing NewsAggregator

Once you have a working ThreadPool, you should flesh out and reimplement the

NewsAggregator class using two private ThreadPools. Your starter repo included pretty much the same news-aggregator.h and news-aggregator.cc files we started you off with for assign5.

Why two ThreadPools instead of just one? I want one ThreadPool (of size 3) to manage a collection of worker threads that download RSS XML documents, and I want a second ThreadPool (of size 20) to manage a second group of workers dedicated to news article downloads.

To simplify the implementation, don‚Äôt worry about limiting the number of simultaneous connections to any given server. The two ThreadPools you‚Äôre using are pretty small, so it‚Äôs unlikely any single server will be overwhelmed by your requests.

Note, however, that some Assignment 5 constraints carry over to Assignment 6.

‚óè Make sure you never download the same exact URL twice. This is actually a constraint imposed by the XML parsing libraries themselves, and since it‚Äôs easy to keep track of previously downloaded URLs, I require that you do.

‚óè Be sure to manage the running intersections as you did for assign5 as you come across articles with the same title and server. This‚Äôll require you to lift some code out of your Assignment 5 submission and repurpose it to contribute to Assignment 6.

Relevant New Files

The files we‚Äôre giving you comprise a near proper superset of the files we gave you for Assignment 5. The new files are: thread-pool.h/cc

thread-pool.h presents the interface for the ThreadPool class, which you are responsible for implementing. Naturally, you‚Äôll want to extend the private section of the class definition to give it more state and the set of helper methods needed to build it, and you‚Äôll need to flesh out the implementations of the public methods in thread-pool.cc.

tptest.cc

tptest.cc contains the trivial program I posted above and is used to verify the most basic of functionality come sanitycheck time.

You shouldn‚Äôt change this file. If you want to exercise your ThreadPool implementation, you should add tests to tpcustomtest.cc, discussed below.

tpcustomtest.cc

tpcustomtest.cc contains a collection of functions you can use to exercise your ThreadPool. This is for you to play with and flesh out with as many additional tests as you can dream of to ensure your ThreadPool is working brilliantly. I need you to leave tptest.cc alone so you can sanity check your ThreadPool against mine via tptest. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve included this extra file for you.

Getting The Code

Go ahead and clone the mercurial repository that we‚Äôve set up for you by typing:

poohbear@myth30:~$ hg clone /usr/class/cs110/repos/assign6/$USER assign6

The code base you‚Äôre cloning is more or less identical to that you cloned for Assignment 5, save for the fact that there are three more files: thread-pool.h, thread-pool.cc, tptest.cc, and tpcustomtest.cc. The Makefile has also been updated to build tptest and tpcustomtest and include thread-pool.cc into the fold when building aggregate.

As always, compile more often than you blink, test incrementally, and hgcommit with every bugfree step toward your final solution. Of course, be sure to run /usr/class/cs110/tools/submit when you‚Äôre done.

Grading

Your assignments will be exercised using the tests we‚Äôve exposed, plus quite a few of others. I reserve the right to add tests and change point values if during grading I find some features aren‚Äôt being exercised, but I‚Äôm fairly certain the breakdown presented below is a solid approximation. Note that your ThreadPool, because it can be tested in isolation of the XML parsing library, can be examined for memory access errors and leaks.
